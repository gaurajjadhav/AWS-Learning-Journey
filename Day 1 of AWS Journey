 Day 1: Cloud Concepts Overview – Detailed Notes

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the **on-demand delivery** of computing resources—such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and 
intelligence—over the internet with **pay-as-you-go pricing**.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Benefits of Cloud Computing
 Benefit               Description     

Cost-Efficient         Pay only for what you use; no upfront hardware investment.                   
Scalable               Easily scale up or down depending on demand (auto-scaling, elastic load).   
Agile & Fast           Quickly deploy and test new apps and services, reducing time-to-market.    
Global Reach           Deploy apps and services closer to users with data centers worldwide.       
Secure                 Built-in security features, compliance standards, and data protection.
